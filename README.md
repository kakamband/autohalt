# AutoHalt

A Firefox web extension to turn off autoplaying of suggested videos.

Websites with media content often have an "autoplay next" feature to
automatically begin playing related or suggested content after the end of the
content a user has selected. Some users may consider this an anti-feature
designed to prolong engagement without the user's consent. This extension seeks
to turn off such functionality by default, putting control back in the user's
hands.

* **Gfycat**: Turns the "Autoplay Related GIFs" switch to off. The user can
