# AutoPause

A Firefox web extension to turn off autoplay by default on supported websites.

Websites with media content often have an "autoplay" feature to automatically
begin playing related or suggested content after the end of the content a user
has selected. Some users may consider this an anti-feature designed to prolong
engagement without the user's consent. This extension seeks to turn off such
functionality by default, putting control back in the user's hands.
